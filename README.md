# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple Java terminal-based game where the computer randomly selects a number and the player tries to guess it. The game provides feedback for each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also keeps track of the number of attempts the player takes to guess the correct number.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to practice **Java programming**, **loops**, **conditional statements**, and **user input handling**.

## Features
- Generates a random number between **1 and 100**.
- Prompts the player to input their guess.
- Gives feedback if the guess is **too high** or **too low**.
- Tracks the number of attempts.
- Congratulates the player once the correct number is guessed.

---

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100.
3. Enter your guesses in the terminal.
4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
6. The program will display the total number of attempts.

## Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above** installed.
- A **terminal/command prompt** to run the Java program.
